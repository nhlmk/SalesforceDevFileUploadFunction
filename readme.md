Hi everyone! This is Nihal. 

I created this framework to test if I can upload different types of 
folders into the **Salesforce Developer** platform. You can check `stepDefinitions`
for further understanding about the test. And there is also `utilities`, so you can
figure out the coding principles.

If we look how it works, first you need to run `CukesRunner` class
under the project's own package. In order to initialize the launch,
tags which stated in the `runners` and `resources` packages must be match. 
Under `resources` path, you can see `feature` files. In each feature
file, you can see tags related to the test case. You can paste the tag
just like in the example I left in the CukesRunner class. 


Then all you need to do is clicking the `Run` button... 

**Let the magic happen!**
